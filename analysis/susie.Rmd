## Idea

Assume we have a p-dimensional random vector $\mathbf{b}\in R^p$, in which **at most** $L$ elements are non-zero. Then $\mathbf{b}$ can be written as a sum of $L$ random vectors $\mathbf{b}=\sum_{l=1}^L \mathbf{b}_l$, where $\mathbf{b}_l$ is a p-dimensional vector with one non-zero element. In SuSiE, $\mathbf{b}_l$ is modeled as $\mathbf{b}_l = \gamma_l b_l$ where $\gamma_l\sim Categorical(\mathbf{\pi})$ and $b_l\sim N(0,\sigma_{0l}^2)$.

This additive structure is of particular interest to me.
