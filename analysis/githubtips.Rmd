## Introduction

1. If I want to pull(clone) a repository to my local computer, do : `git clone https://github.com/stephenslab/smashr.git`

Then it clones the repository to the current path.

2. check the status of branch, know what are not committed: `git status`

If there are files end with `-`, for example, 

Untracked files:(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	ashsmooth.R~

Then type `rm *~` to delete it. It's temporary file. 

3. If want to see what has changed in the file, type `git diff`.

4. If satisfied with the change, commit it by `git commit -a -m "message"`

5. Then `git push` to github.

6. If want to test modified file with out re-install the package, do `devtools::load_all()`.

7. If want to test the functions before commit the changes, do `devtools::test()`. 

```{r}

```
