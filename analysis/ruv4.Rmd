## Introduction

Assume true relationship, $Y = XB + Z\Gamma + E$, $Z$ is unobserved and can be high correlated with $X$. Goal: find a good surrogate of $Z$, split the effects of $X$ and $Z$ on $Y$. 

Methods: 

1. Remove top PCs of $Y$(Price et al. (2006)). Need $Z\Gamma$ dominates $XB$, otherwise removes effects of $X$.

2. Remove top PCs of $Y-X\hat B$. But confounder effects $Z\Gamma$ are also removed.

3. SVA. The idea is to find a subset of [negative control] genes that are associated with Z but not with X. Weighted SVD with gene weight $p(B_i=0,\Gamma_i\neq 0|Y,X,\hat Z)$.

4. RUV-4. Need to know genes $B_i=0$

5. LEAPP. Assume $B$ is sparse and $Z = X\alpha + W$. Assume we have one variable of interest $B=\beta^T$, then model is $$Y = X(\beta+\Gamma\alpha)^T+(W\Gamma+E)$$



QR decompositon of $X$ is $X=QR$, where $R=(||x||_2,0,0,...,0)^T$. Then $$Q^TY = R\beta^T+Q^TZ\Gamma^T+Q^TE$$.

Then the second to the last row of $Q^TY$ follows $N(0,\Gamma\Gamma^T+E)$.




Open problems:
1. In addition to multiple testing, the surrogate variable analysis
framework can solve many other high-dimensional problems, e.g.,
classification
2. Beyond linear models: High-dimensional random effects model;
GLM; Varying coefficients model; Tree-based methods...
3. Beyond PCA
