RNA velocity is the time derivative of the gene expression state. It can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols.

Key equation: the first time derivative of the spliced mRNA abundance (RNA velocity) is determined by the balance between production of spliced mRNA from unspliced mRNA, and the mRNA degradation, $\frac{ds}{dt} = u-\gamma*s$.

This simple model can be used to extrapolate the mature mRNA abundance into the future
